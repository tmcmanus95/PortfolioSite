        I'm a passionate individual who embarked on a unique journey after
        graduating from Loyola in 2017 with dual degrees in Psychology and
        Creative Writing. Following my academic pursuits, I dedicated a
        transformative year to teaching English in South Korea, where I had the
        privilege of working with a class of North Korean refugees. This
        experience fueled my commitment to contributing positively to the lives
        of others.

      <p className=" shadow-lg p-10 rounded-xl  m-5">
        In the years that followed, I found my calling as a Behavioral Health
        Technician, specializing in working with adults with developmental
        disabilities. My role involves fostering their growth and supporting the
        attainment of their goals, a rewarding endeavor that has shaped my
        perspective on the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in all
        facets of life.

      <p className=" shadow-lg p-10 rounded-xl  m-5">
        My aspirations now lead me into the dynamic realm of technology, where I
        aim to leverage my diverse background to contribute to a more inclusive
        internet for everyone. Inspired by the impactful work of others, I am
        particularly drawn to the potential of large language models in creating
        accessible versions of web pages and communication devices. I believe in
        the power of technology to bridge gaps and enhance the lives of
        individuals with diverse needs. Outside of my professional pursuits, I
        find joy in continuous learning and personal growth.

        I am currently immersed in the study of Korean and am a dedicated
        advocate for maintaining a healthy lifestyle through regular exercise. I
        look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals who share my
        passion for making a positive impact in the tech landscape and beyond.
